:::::: When to Use Proxy :::::

Understanding how to use a pattern is important.

Understanding when to use it is critical.

Let’s talk about when to use the Proxy pattern:

When we want a simplified version of a complex or heavy object. In this case, we may represent it with a skeleton object which loads the original object on demand, also called as lazy initialization. This is known as the Virtual Proxy
When the original object is present in different address space, and we want to represent it locally. We can create a proxy which does all the necessary boilerplate stuff like creating and maintaining the connection, encoding, decoding, etc., while the client accesses it as it was present in their local address space. This is called the Remote Proxy
When we want to add a layer of security to the original underlying object to provide controlled access based on access rights of the client. This is called Protection Proxy
